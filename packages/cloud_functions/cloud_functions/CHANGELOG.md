Along with the below changes, the plugin has been reworked to bring it inline with the federated plugin setup along with documentation and additional unit and end-to-end tests. The API has mainly been kept the same, however there are some breaking changes.

 - **`FirebaseFunctions`**:
   - **DEPRECATED**: Class `CloudFunctions` is now deprecated. Use `FirebaseFunctions` instead.
   - **DEPRECATED**: Calling `CloudFunctions.instance` or `CloudFunctions(app: app, region: region)` is now deprecated. Use `FirebaseFunctions.instance` or `FirebaseFunctions.instanceFor(app: app, region: region)` instead.
   - **DEPRECATED**: Calling `getHttpsCallable(functionName: functionName)` is deprecated in favor of `httpsCallable(functionName)`
   - **DEPRECATED**: `CloudFunctionsException` is deprecated in favor of `FirebaseFunctionsException`.
   - **NEW**: `FirebaseFunctionsException` now exposes a `details` property to retrieve any additional data provided with the exception returned by a HTTPS callable function.
   - **NEW**: Internally, instances of `FirebaseFunctions` are now cached and lazily loaded.
   - **NEW**: `httpsCallable` accepts an instance of `HttpsCallableOptions` (see below).


 - **`HttpsCallable`**:
   - **DEPRECATED**: Setting `timeout` is deprecated in favor of using `HttpsCallableOptions` (see below).


 - **`HttpsCallableResult`**:
   - **BREAKING**: `data` is now read-only, only its getter is exposed.
   - **FIX**: `HttpsCallableResult`'s `data` property can now return a Map, List or a primitive value. Previously the Web implementation incorrectly assumed that a Map was always returned by the HTTPS callable function.


 - **`HttpsCallableOptions`**:
   - **NEW**: This new class has been created to support setting options for `httpsCallable` instances.

## 0.6.0+1

  [Callable functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable)
  are similar to other HTTP functions, with these additional features:

  - With callables, Firebase Authentication and FCM tokens are
    automatically included in requests.
  - The functions.https.onCall trigger automatically deserializes
    the request body and validates auth tokens.
