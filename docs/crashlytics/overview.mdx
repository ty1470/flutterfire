##  What does it do?

Crashlytics helps you to collect analytics and details about crashes and errors that occur in your app. It does this through three aspects:

- **Logs**: Log events in your app to be sent with the crash report for context if your app crashes.
- **Crash reports**: Every crash is automatically turned into a crash report and sent when the application next opens.
- **Stack traces**: Even when an error is caught and your app recovers, the Dart stack trace can still be sent.

## Installation

### 1. Add dependency

```yaml {5} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core }}"
  firebase_crashlytics: "^{{ plugins.firebase_crashlytics }}"
```

### 2. Download dependency

```
$ flutter pub get
```

### 3. Platform integration

If you are migrating from a previous version of Crashlytics that used Fabric, please follow these
guides and remove any legacy Fabric integration steps from your project:

 - [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/upgrade-sdk?platform=android).
 - [iOS/macOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/upgrade-sdk?platform=ios).

#### a. Android

1. Add the following classpaths to your `android/build.gradle` file.

```groovy {3} title="android/build.gradle"
dependencies {
  // ... other dependencies
  classpath 'com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.2.0'
}
```

2. Apply the following to your `android/app/build.gradle` file.

```groovy {3} title="android/app/build.gradle"
// ... other imports

apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'

android {
  // ... your android config
}
```

#### b. iOS

1. From Xcode select `Runner` from the project navigation.
2. Select the `Build Phases` tab, then click `+ > New Run Script Phase`.
3. Add `${PODS_ROOT}/FirebaseCrashlytics/run` to the `Type a script...` text box.
4. Optionally you can also provide your app's built `Info.plist` location to the build phase's Input Files field:
For example: `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(INFOPLIST_PATH)`

### 4. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
$ flutter run
```

## Next steps
