## What does it do?

Cloud Functions for Firebase let you automatically run backend code in response to events
triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your code is stored in Google's cloud
and runs in a managed environment. There's no need to manage and scale your own servers.

## Installation

Before installing the Cloud Functions for Firebase plugin, ensure that you have followed the [Getting Started](../overview.mdx) documentation
and have initialized FlutterFire.

### 1. Add dependency

Add the [`cloud_functions`](https://pub.dev/packages/cloud_functions) dependency to your projects `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml {5} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core }}"
  cloud_functions: "^{{ plugins.cloud_functions }}"
```

### 2. Download dependency

Download the dependency by running the following command in your project:

```bash
$ flutter pub get
```

### 3. (Web Only) Add the SDK

If using FlutterFire on the web, add the [`firebase-functions`](!cloud_functions) JavaScript SDK to your `index.html` file:

```html {5} title="web/index.html"
<html>
  ...
  <body>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/{{ web.firebase_cdn }}/firebase-app.js"></script>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/{{ web.firebase_cdn }}/firebase-functions.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 4. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
$ flutter run
```
