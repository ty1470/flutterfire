title: Using Cloud Functions for Firebase
sidebar_label: Usage
---

To start using the Cloud Functions for Firebase package within your project, import it at the top of your project files:

```dart
import 'package:cloud_functions/cloud_functions.dart';
```

Before using Cloud Functions, you must first have ensured you have [initialized FlutterFire](overview#initializing-flutterfire).

To create a new Cloud Functions for Firebase instance, call the [`instance`](!cloud_functions.FirebaseFunctions.instance) getter on [`FirebaseFunctions`](!cloud_functions.FirebaseFunctions):

```dart
FirebaseFunctions functions = FirebaseFunctions.instance;
```

By default, this allows you to interact with Cloud Functions using the default Firebase App used whilst installing Cloud Functions on your
platform. If however you'd like to use Cloud Functions with a secondary Firebase App, use the [`instanceFor`](!cloud_functions.FirebaseFunctions.instanceFor) method:

```dart
FirebaseApp secondary = Firebase.app('Secondary');
FirebaseFunctions secondaryApp = FirebaseFunctions.instanceFor(app: secondary);
```

## Calling Endpoints

Assuming we have a deployed function named `listFruit`, we can call the Cloud Function using the `httpsCallable` method.
For example:

```javascript title="Deployed Function"
const functions = require('firebase-functions');

exports.listFruit = functions.https.onCall((data, context) => {
  return ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Fig", "Grapes"]
});
```

Within Flutter, the function can be called, and the results accessed:

```dart
import 'package:cloud_functions/cloud_functions.dart';

Future<void> getFruit() async {
  HttpsCallable callable = FirebaseFunctions.instance.httpsCallable('listFruit');
  final results = await callable();
  List fruit = results.data;  // ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date", "Fig", "Grapes"]
}
```

### Specifying regions

If you wish to specify a region for a Cloud Function that runs in any region other than `us-central1`, you can do this
by passing the region to the FirebaseFunctions instance, using `instanceFor`:

```dart highlight={2}
HttpsCallableResult callable = await FirebaseFunctions
  .instanceFor(region: 'europe-west1')
  .httpsCallable('getName');
```


## Emulator Usage

If you are using the local Cloud Functions emulators, then it is possible to connect to these using the `useFunctionsEmulator` method.
Ensure you pass the correct port on which the Firebase emulator is running on.


```dart
FirebaseFunctions.instance
  .useFunctionsEmulator(origin: 'http://localhost:5000')
  .httpsCallable('myCloudFunction');
```


### iOS

When using the Firebase emulator while debugging an iOS application, you may receive an error regarding App Transport Security. To fix it, please use the following steps:

1. Open ios/Runner.xcworkspace in Xcode.
2. Open Runner/info.plist.
3. Add a property called App Transport Security Settings.
4. Right click on that property and click Add Row.
5. Add a property called Allows Local Networking and enter its value as YES.

### Android

If you are targeting apps using Android 8.0+, the platform will block the http endpoint.  The simplest solution is to change
this in your **debug** builds by adding the following to your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<application
  android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
/>
```


If you are concerned about security, you can set a more advanced [per-host network security file](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-config)
