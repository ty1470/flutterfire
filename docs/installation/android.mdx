Before using FlutterFire on Android, you must first connect to your Firebase project with your Android application.

## Generating a Firebase project configuration file

On the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/overview), add a new Android app or select an
existing Android app for your Firebase project.

The "Android package name" must match your local project's package name that was created when you started the
Flutter project. The current package name can be found in your module (app-level) Gradle file,
usually `android/app/build.gradle`, `defaultConfig` section (example package name: `com.yourcompany.yourproject`).

> When creating a new Android app "debug signing certificate SHA-1" is optional, however, it is required for Dynamic Links
> & Phone Authentication. To generate a certificate run `cd android && ./gradlew signingReport` and copy the SHA1 from
> the `debug` key. This generates two variant keys. You can copy the 'SHA1' that belongs to the `debugAndroidTest` variant key option.

Once your Android app has been registered, download the configuration file from the Firebase Console (the file is called
`google-services.json`). Add this file into the `android/app` directory within your Flutter project.

## Installing your Firebase configuration file

To allow Firebase to use the configuration on Android, the 'google-services' plugin must be applied on the project. This requires
modification to two files in the `android/` directory.

First, add the 'google-services' plugin as a dependency inside of the `android/build.gradle` file:

```java {4} title="android/build.gradle"
buildscript {
  dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:{{ android.google_services }}'
  }
}
```

Lastly, execute the plugin by adding the following underneath the line `apply plugin: 'com.android.application'`, within
the `/android/app/build.gradle` file:

```java title="android/app/build.gradle"
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

## Building for Android

Due to the large number of classes in some of the Firebase SDKs (specifically Firestore), it may bump you over the 64k method limit on the Android
 build system and you may get an error stating `Error while merging dex archives: The number of method references in a .dex file cannot exceed 64K`.

If you do get this error, we suggest enabling Multidex for Android.

### Enabling Multidex

If your app only targets Android 21 or higher (`minSdkVersion`) then multidex is already enabled by default and you do not need the multidex support library.

However, if your `minSdkVersion` is set to 20 or lower, then you must use the multidex support library and make the following modifications to your app project:

Open the `/android/app/build.gradle` file.  Under `dependencies` add the multidex module, and enable it within
the `defaultConfig`:

```groovy highlight={6,11}
android {
    defaultConfig {
        // ...
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 28
        multiDexEnabled true
    }
}

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3'
}
```

Visit the [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex#mdex-gradle) to learn more.

## Initializing FlutterFire

Once complete follow the instructions on [Initializing FlutterFire](../overview.mdx#initializing-flutterfire).
